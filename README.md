dns-tester

dns-tester  will search all DNS servers on the internet and report back which ones are unreachable, are returning the wrong address and which ones have the incorrect TTL value set

`usage: python dns-tester.py -d <domain to test> -c <correct ip address> -t <ttl you expect>`

Use `python dns-test.py --help for all the options`
